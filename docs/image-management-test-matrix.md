# Image Management Test Matrix

Environment: Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3100`, `ADMIN_IMAGE_API_TOKEN=test-token`, manifest `/tmp/pns-image-manifest-test.json`, storage `/tmp/pns-image-storage-test`. Tests use isolated data and clean it up on exit.

| DINING-DELETE-001..007 | Dining DELETE | Delete dining reference and isolate room data | Temporary dining reference | Correct reference removed; cross-scope rejected | Passed | PASS |
| PERSIST-001..004 | Persistence | Re-read metadata and storage state | Temporary manifest/storage | Records and paths survive requests | Passed; manifest and files verified | PASS |
| REG-003 | Public integration | Public room/dining reads remain category isolated | No admin token | `200`; no category mixing | Passed for all categories | PASS |
| UI-001, REG-010 | Admin page | Direct admin route availability | Existing Next server | Admin route returns `200` | Route-level check available; browser interaction not exercised | NOT RUN |
| UI-002..008 | Admin UI | Category rendering, thumbnails, counts, empty states | Browser automation | Existing admin UI works for all categories | No browser test framework is installed | BLOCKED |
| UI-UPLOAD-001..008 | Admin UI | Upload form, preview, cancel, duplicate-submit/error states | Browser automation | Correct UI state and API interaction | No browser test framework is installed | BLOCKED |
| UI-URL-001..007 | Admin UI | URL form, preview, persistence, external labeling | Browser automation | Correct UI state and saved metadata | No browser test framework is installed | BLOCKED |
| UI-PATH-001..005 | Admin UI | URL/path display and secret/path redaction | Browser automation | Public/relative paths visible; absolute paths hidden | API data verified; visual UI not exercised | BLOCKED |
| UI-DELETE-001..007, UI-STATE-001..007 | Admin UI | Confirmation, pending states, refresh, accessibility, mobile | Browser automation | Correct interaction behavior | No browser test framework is installed | BLOCKED |
| REG-001..012 | Website regression | Public pages and API route registration | Next build/server | Existing routes remain available | Production build passed; route smoke checks limited | PASS WITH ISSUES |
| ERR-001..013 | Diagnostics | Storage/malformed request/auth failure responses | Controlled HTTP failures | Status, request ID, sanitized error | Auth/validation verified; storage permission faults not automated | NOT RUN |

## Automated command

```sh
IMAGE_TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3100 \
IMAGE_TEST_TOKEN=test-token \
PNS_IMAGE_MANIFEST=/tmp/pns-image-manifest-test.json \
PNS_IMAGE_STORAGE_DIR=/tmp/pns-image-storage-test \
npm run test:image-management
```

Result: 10 test groups passed, 0 failed. The suite is implemented in `tests/image-management-smoke.mjs` and uses Node's built-in test runner; no additional test dependency was introduced.
